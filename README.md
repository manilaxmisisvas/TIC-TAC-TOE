📖 Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Player X starts first.

Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
